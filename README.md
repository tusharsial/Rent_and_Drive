Understanding Notary Naming (GUNs)
Notary employs a unique naming convention known as Globally Unique Names (GUNs) to precisely identify and reference Docker images. GUNs comprise three crucial components: the repository, the target (image or tag), and the cryptographic digest. The repository serves as a namespace, the target specifies the image or tag, and the digest ensures cryptographic integrity. This naming scheme is fundamental to secure image identification, facilitating unambiguous references and enabling robust verification of image authenticity and integrity.
