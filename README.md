Docker Content Trust (DCT), an embedded security feature in Docker, relies on Notary for image signing and verification. DCT builds upon Notary's capabilities, emphasizing the signing of container images to establish trust in the deployment process. Through Notary, DCT ensures that only signed and verified images are used, minimizing the risk of deploying compromised or unauthenticated containers. This overview sets the stage for a deeper understanding of image signing practices within Docker and their role in upholding container security.
