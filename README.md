The practice of image signing is foundational to container security, addressing the need for provenance, integrity, and authenticity verification. Image signing involves attaching a cryptographic signature to a container image, serving as a verifiable proof of its origin and integrity. In the realm of DevSecOps, understanding the importance of image signing is critical. It establishes a secure foundation for deploying containers in production environments, mitigating the risk of deploying compromised or tampered containers. By adopting image signing practices, organizations instill confidence in their containerized ecosystems, fostering a culture of security and trust.
