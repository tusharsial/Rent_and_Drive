Notary leverages TUF principles to establish a secure image signing and verification process. The synergy between TUF and Notary is evident in the application of role-based access control, threshold signatures, and timestamping within the container security context. TUF provides the theoretical framework, and Notary implements these principles to fortify the integrity of containerized applications, ensuring a trustworthy and resilient container deployment pipeline.
